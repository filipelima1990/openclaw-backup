# User Guide: Markdown Preview in Mission Control

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-28

---

## What's New?

You can now **preview markdown (.md) files** directly in your browser from the Mission Control deliverables tab!

**Before:** You had to open the file in the system file manager (which didn't work on Linux)
**After:** Click the eye icon to view beautifully rendered markdown in a new tab

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Open a Task with Deliverables

Navigate to any task that has file deliverables (markdown, HTML, etc.)

### Step 2: Look for the Eye Icon

For files that can be previewed, you'll see an **eye icon** (👁️) in the actions toolbar.

**Supported file types:**
- `.md` - Markdown files (NEW!)
- `.markdown` - Markdown files (NEW!)
- `.html` - HTML files (existing)
- `.htm` - HTML files (existing)

### Step 3: Click to Preview

Click the eye icon, and the file will open in a new browser tab with:
- ✅ Clean, modern styling
- ✅ Readable formatting
- ✅ Dark code blocks
- ✅ Responsive design

---

## Example

### Deliverables List

```
📄 COMPARISON_REPORT.md
   👁️ 🔗

📄 oddsportal_homepage_sample.html
   👁️ 🔗
```

**Icons:**
- `👁️` = Preview in browser (eye icon)
- `🔗` = Open in file manager (external link icon)

### What Happens When You Click

1. **Eye icon** → Opens rendered markdown in new tab
2. **Link icon** → Opens the file location in your system file manager

---

## What Gets Rendered

The markdown preview supports:

✅ **Headers**
```markdown
# Main Heading
## Subheading
### Minor Heading
```

✅ **Text Formatting**
```markdown
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
```

✅ **Code**
```markdown
`inline code`
```
```python
def function():
    return "code block"
```

✅ **Links**
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

✅ **Lists**
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item

1. Numbered item
2. Another item
```

✅ **Blockquotes**
```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Button Not Showing?

**The eye icon only appears for previewable files:**
- ✅ `.md`, `.markdown`, `.html`, `.htm` files
- ❌ Other file types (`.txt`, `.json`, `.py`, etc.)

For non-previewable files, use the **link icon** to open in the file manager.

### Preview Opens Blank?

Possible causes:
1. File path is invalid
2. File has been moved or deleted
3. Permission issue (file outside allowed directories)

**Solution:** Use the link icon to open in file manager and check if the file exists.

### Preview Looks Wrong?

The preview uses a simple markdown parser. For complex markdown with:
- Tables
- Images
- Advanced formatting

You may see basic rendering instead. This is expected - use a full markdown editor for complex files.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, there are no keyboard shortcuts for previewing. You need to click the eye icon with your mouse.

**Future enhancement:** Keyboard shortcut support

---

## Security

The markdown preview includes security protections:

✅ Only allows `.md` and `.markdown` files
✅ Validates file paths (prevents directory traversal)
✅ Only allows files from workspace/projects directories
✅ HTML escaping (prevents XSS attacks)

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Reading

Open multiple markdown files in separate browser tabs to compare them.

### Copying Code

The preview is read-only, but you can select and copy text from code blocks.

### Printing

Use `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac) to print the preview. The styling is optimized for paper.

### Mobile Friendly

The preview works on mobile devices with a responsive layout.
