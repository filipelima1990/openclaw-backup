# Quick Start: OpenClaw Sessions Cleanup

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**For:** Filipe

---

## The Problem

Your OpenClaw sessions are using **~51MB** of storage with **95 deleted/reset files** that are just taking up space.

---

## Quick Solution (3 steps)

### Step 1: Review what will be deleted

```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/review-existing-openclaw-sessions
./cleanup_sessions.sh --dry-run
```

This shows a **safe preview** of what will be deleted.

---

### Step 2: Review the detailed report

Open the full report to understand what's safe to delete:

```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/review-existing-openclaw-sessions
cat SESSIONS_REVIEW_REPORT.md | less
```

---

### Step 3: Run cleanup (when ready)

```bash
# Conservative cleanup (reclaim 2-3 MB, safe)
./cleanup_sessions.sh

# Or aggressive (reclaim 10-15 MB)
./cleanup_sessions.sh --aggressive
```

---

## What Gets Deleted?

### Conservative Mode (Default - Recommended)

**Reclaims:** 2-3 MB
**Risk:** Low

- ✅ Old sessions (> 5 days old)
- ✅ Large deleted/reset files (> 1MB)
- ✅ Very old deleted/reset files (> 30 days)

### Aggressive Mode

**Reclaims:** 10-15 MB
**Risk:** Medium

- ✅ All deleted/reset files (any size)
- ✅ Old sessions (> 2 days old)

### Full Cleanup Mode

**Reclaims:** 40-45 MB
**Risk:** High

- ⚠️ Everything except the current active session
- ⚠️ Cannot recover old sessions

---

## Safety Features

✅ **Dry run mode** - Preview before deleting
✅ **Active session protection** - Never deletes current session
✅ **Size-based deletion** - Only deletes large/old files
✅ **Detailed output** - Shows exactly what's being deleted

---

## After Cleanup

1. **Verify Mission Control works:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Mission Control is accessible
   curl http://localhost:4000
   ```

2. **Check disk space:**
   ```bash
   du -sh /root/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions
   ```

3. **Review active sessions:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /root/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl
   ```

---

## Current Status

| Item | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Storage Used** | ~51 MB |
| **Active Sessions** | 9 |
| **Deleted/Reset Files** | 95 |
| **Safe to Reclaim** | 40-45 MB |

---

## Need Help?

Run the cleanup script with `--help`:
```bash
./cleanup_sessions.sh --help
```

---

**Recommendation:** Start with **conservative mode** and see if that's enough space reclaimed. If you need more, try aggressive mode.
